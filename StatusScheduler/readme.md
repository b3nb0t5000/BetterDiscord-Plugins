# Status Scheduler BetterDiscord plugin
I have never wrote a BetterDiscord plugin before and have very little experience with JS. Nevertheless, I'm gonna try to write a Status Scheduler plugin that will allow the user to:
- [ ] Set an amount of time for a Discord status to last (online, idle, DND, etc) in minutes/hours
- [ ] Or do it by a time during the day (3:00 PM - 1:00 AM)

I doubt I will finish this project xD
